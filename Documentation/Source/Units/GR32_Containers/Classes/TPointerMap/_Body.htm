<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">TPointerMap implements a simple pointer to pointer map. It uses a hash-like structure internally, thus, data lookup is very fast compared to an iterative approach - especially if you have many entries in the map. However, it is also more limited than a list approach since it does not support index based operation. If you need to iterate through a pointer map please refer to <a href="../TPointerMapIterator/_Body.htm">TPointerMapIterator</a>.</p>
