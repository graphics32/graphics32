<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body"><strong>TRectList</strong> is a container class for storing rectangles. Handling is similar to TList, but instead of storing pointers it stores <em>TRect</em>. Please refer to the TList documentation for further details. </p>
<p class="Body">Internally the rectangles are saved in an array structure  instead of  a pointer based approach, so as to have a more memory efficient storage. </p>
