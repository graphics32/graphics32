<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">TKernelSampler is a base class for samplers that compute an output sample by collecting a number of samples in a local region of the actual sample coordinate. Subsamples are collected from a regular sampling grid by storing the sample </p>
<p class="Body">The size of the grid is equal to the size of the associated kernel. Descendants of this class should  override the protected <em>UpdateBuffer</em> method. </p>
