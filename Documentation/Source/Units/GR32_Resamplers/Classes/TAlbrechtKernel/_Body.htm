<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">A <em>sinc</em> kernel constrained by Albrecht window functions.<br>
Those special window functions are used in spectral analysis to reduce the effect of spectral leakage. Windows with low sidelobe amplitude are necessary for the detection of small signals when highly dynamic spectra are concerned. For further details see: "A FAMILY OF COSINE-SUM WINDOWS FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION MEASUREMENTS" by Hans-Helge Albrecht</p>
