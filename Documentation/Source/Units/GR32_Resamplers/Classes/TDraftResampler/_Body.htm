<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">This class implements an algorithm for fast downsampling. The 
  result is better than nearest neighbor interpolation, but it is not quite as 
  good as linear resampling. Fast downsampling is very useful for generation of 
  thumbnail images.</p>
<p class="Body">For upsampling the same method is used as in <a href="../TLinearResampler/_Body.htm">TLinearResampler</a>.</p>
