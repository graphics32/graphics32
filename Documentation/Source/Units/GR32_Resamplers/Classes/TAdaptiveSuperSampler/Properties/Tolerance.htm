<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">Adaptive supersampling uses a tolerance parameter to limit the recursion depth. If the difference between two samples is less than the tolerance, then the recursion will stop. By default the difference between two colors is computed as the sum of the componentwise differences between the R, G and B components. It is possible to change this evaluation by overriding the protected CompareColors method.</p>
