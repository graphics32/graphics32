<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">The base class for <a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TBitmap32/_Body.htm">TBitmap32</a>-specific rasterizers. A rasterizer is the final step in a sampler setup, the step responsible for calling the associated samplers and writing the results into the provided destination bitmap. A separated rasterization process allows for different types of <i>on-screen</i> realizations. For example a <a href="../TProgressiveRasterizer/_Body.htm">progressive rasterizer</a> will increase the resolution of the result in progressive steps, which can keep the end user informed about the progression of the overall process. Moreover it provides perceptual information about the rendering, which can be useful for validation purposes.</p>
