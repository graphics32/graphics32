<h2>Description</h2>
		<p class="Body">A rasterization method where sample locations are choosen according to a fractal pattern called <i>swizzling</i>. An advantage with this pattern is that it may benefit from local coherency in the sampling method used, and moreover optimize the CPU cache usage.
