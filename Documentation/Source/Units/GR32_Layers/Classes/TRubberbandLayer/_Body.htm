<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">This class implements a rubber band, allowing to move and resize 
  other positioned layers at run-time. The layer paints itself at <a href="../../../../Additional%20Topics/Using%20TImage32/Paint%20Stages.htm#GDI%20Overlays">GDI 
  Overlays</a> stage, using the standard GDI methods.</p>
<p class="Body">It is a good idea to keep <span class="EmptyRef">TRubberbandLayer</span> 
  on top of other layers so that they don't intercept mouse messages.</p>
<p class="Body"><font color="#CC0000">Note, that this is a preliminary implementation 
  of rubber banding, there is a lot to be done here to make its behavior more 
  consistent, which will be done in future versions of the library. However, most 
  likely I will keep names and general meaning of most properties and methods.</font></p>
