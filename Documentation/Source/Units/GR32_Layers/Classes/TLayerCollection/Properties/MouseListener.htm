<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">Indicates the layer which has captured mouse messages. By default, 
  the layer captures mouse if the left mouse button is pressed and releases it 
  when the mouse button is released.</p>
<p class="Body">Note, that since layers have nothing to do with windowed controls, 
  this property is just a simulation of standard mouse capturing. Windows still 
  'thinks' that the mouse is captured to the owner of the layer collection (<a href="../../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/_Body.htm">TCustomImage32</a>), 
  which in turn redirects mouse messages to an appropriate layer.</p>
