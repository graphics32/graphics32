<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">Transform</span> is responsible for arbitrary 
  geometrical transformations of bitmaps or their fragments. The current version 
  supports only affine and projective transformations.</p>
<p class="Body">The <b>Transformation</b> parameter is a reference to a descendant 
  of an abstract <a href="../../GR32_Transforms/Classes/TTransformation/_Body.htm">TTransformation</a> 
  class. It specifies all necessary transformation parameters. </p>
<p class="Body">When <b>Src</b>.<a href="../../GR32/Classes/TCustomBitmap32/Properties/StretchFilter.htm">StretchFilter</a> 
  is different from sfNearest, <b>Transform</b> uses bilinear interpolation for 
  magnification (along any axis) as for minification, it is not as accurate as 
  <a href="../../GR32_Resamplers/Routines/StretchTransfer.htm">StretchTransfer</a> function. If you need better 
  quality when minimizing the bitmaps, transform them into the temporary buffer 
  so that there is no minification involved, then <a href="../../GR32_Resamplers/Routines/StretchTransfer.htm">StretchTransfer</a> 
  to a final bitmap. </p>
<p class="Body">The function does not support spline interpolation, if <b>Src</b>.<a href="../../GR32/Classes/TCustomBitmap32/Properties/StretchFilter.htm">StretchFilter</a> 
  is sfSpline, <b>Transform</b> operates as if it were sfLinear. </p>
<p class="Body">There is an issue with antialiasing and edges. How to make them 
  antialiased and still keep the performance? The solution implemented in Graphics32 
  is similar to the one used in OpenGL. You just have to provide the source bitmap 
  (or its region) with transparent edges. In the original image, you’ll have to 
  force the alpha channel on its edges to zeroes, for example, using the <a href="../../GR32_Transforms/Routines/SetBorderTransparent.htm">SetBorderTransparent</a> 
  method. </p>
<p class="Body">Remember, that color is interpolated as well, it means that for 
  nice fadeout the color on the border should match the color of pixels lying 
  next to the border. </p>
<p class="Body">In case the bitmap is transformed in dmOpaque mode, it might be 
  better to keep the color on the edge close to the color of the background.</p>
