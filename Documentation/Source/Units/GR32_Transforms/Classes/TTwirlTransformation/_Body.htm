<h2>Description</h2>
		<p class="Body">This transformation class implements a twirl transformation. The amount of twirl can be controlled with the twirl property. The image below shows how a checkerboard pattern were transformed with this transformation. The <a href="Properties/Twirl.htm">twirl</a> parameter were set very low for illustrative purposes. With high twirl frequencies (more extreme settings of the twirl property), it is recommended that antialiasing steps are taken (e.g. supersampling).<br>
