<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">TCustomImgView32</span> is an extention 
  of <a href="../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/_Body.htm">TCustomImage32</a>, which additionaly 
  provides a couple of scroll bars to simplify operations with images larger then 
  the control area.</p>
<p class="Body">Most of its behavior is inherited from <a href="../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/_Body.htm">TCustomImage32</a>, 
  however some properties are obsolete:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Properties/BitmapAlign.htm">BitmapAlign</a> is 
    no longer used, since the control is always in baCustom mode;</li>
  <li><a href="../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Properties/ScaleMode.htm">ScaleMode</a> is no 
    longer used, the control is always in smScale mode;</li>
</ul>
