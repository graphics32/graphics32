<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">OnChange</span> is an abstract change notification 
  event, which is called by some of the descendants of <a href="../../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomPaintBox32/_Body.htm">TCustomPaintBox32</a> 
  immediately after changes have been made to their contents.</p>
<p class="Body">In <a href="../../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/_Body.htm">TCustomImage32</a>, for example, this 
  includes redirection of change notification events from the contained bitmap 
  and from layers.</p>
<p class="Body">This event, however, is not called by <a href="../../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomPaintBox32/_Body.htm">TCustomPaintBox32</a> 
  control itself, unless you call the <a href="../../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Methods/Changed.htm">Changed</a> 
  method explicitly.</p>
<p class="Body">Change notification may be disabled with <a href="../../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Methods/BeginUpdate.htm">BeginUpdate</a> 
  call and re-enabled with <a href="../../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Methods/EndUpdate.htm">EndUpdate</a> call.</p>
