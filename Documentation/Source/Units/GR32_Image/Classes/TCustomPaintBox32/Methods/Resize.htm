<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">Resize</span> is overriden from <span class="API">TWinControl</span>. 
  It keeps the size of the buffer consistent with control's dimensions after the 
  control resizes. Normally, you will not call this method in your applications.</p>
<p class="Body">Whether the buffer is actually resized or not is influenced by 
  the <a href="../Properties/BufferOversize.htm">BufferOversize</a> property.</p>
<p class="Body">Resizing of the control will also invalidate its buffer.</p>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">Resize</span> generates the standard <span class="API">OnResize</span> 
  event as well.</p>
