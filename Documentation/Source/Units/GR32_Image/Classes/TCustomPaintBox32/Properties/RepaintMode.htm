<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">This property controls the way repaints of the contents are handled by TCustomPaintBox32 and 
  its descendants:</p>
<p class="Body"><b>rmFull</b> - indicates whether always to repaint everything;</p>
<p class="Body"><b>rmDirect</b> - indicates to use a direct repaint rather than a deferred invalidation. Please note, that this mode is not supported for layer supporting control like <a href="../../TCustomImage32/_Body.htm">TCustomImage32</a> and its descendants;</p>
<p class="Body"><b>rmOptimizer</b> - indicates to use the <a href="../../../../../Additional%20Topics/Repaint%20Optimization.htm">repaint optimizer</a> to just repaint changed areas. Especially layer operations benefit from this mode. </p>
