<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">BufferOversize</span> specifies how the 
  back buffer is reallocated when the control is resized. </p>
<p class="Body">When <span class="EmptyRef">BufferOversize</span> equals 0, the 
  back buffer is reallocated each time the control is resized to suite the new 
  control dimensions. </p>
<p class="Body">When set to some positive value (40 by default), the back buffer 
  is allowed to be up to <span class="EmptyRef">BufferOversize</span> pixels larger 
  then the control is in each direction. The buffer resizing algorithm tracks 
  size changes and reallocates the buffer only when its size becomes smaller than 
  size of the buffered area or when the difference between the sizes exceeds the 
  specified amount of pixels.</p>
