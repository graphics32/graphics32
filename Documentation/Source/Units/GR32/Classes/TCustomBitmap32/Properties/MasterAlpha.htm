<p class="Decl"><b>property</b> MasterAlpha: <a href="../../../../GR32/Types/Color%20Types.htm#TColor32">TColor32</a>;</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">When blending a bitmap to the screen or to another bitmap, <span class="EmptyRef">MasterAlpha</span> 
  normally controls the blending factor. The per-pixel opacity, stored in the 
  blended bitmap, is premultiplied with <span class="EmptyRef">MasterAlpha</span>. 
  If the <span class="EmptyRef">MasterAlpha</span> property is $00, the bitmap 
  will be fully transparent, if it is equal to $FF, only per-pixel opacity, stored 
  in bitmap’s alpha channel is used. This property is used only for bitmap blending, 
  it does not affect pixel/line drawing and other similar routines. </p>
<p class="Body">When blending bitmaps in dmCustom draw mode, this property may 
  be used for other purposes. Custom combining routine may use all 32 bits of 
  <span class="EmptyRef">MasterAlpha</span>. </p>
<p class="Body">If the bitmap is in dmBlend draw mode and <span class="EmptyRef">MasterAlpha</span> 
  is not in the [0&#133;255] range, the blending result is not specified, it is 
  your responsibility to keep <span class="EmptyRef">MasterAlpha</span> consistent 
  with current draw mode.</p>
