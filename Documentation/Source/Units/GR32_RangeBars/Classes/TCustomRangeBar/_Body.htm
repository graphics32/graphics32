<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">A base class for <a href="../../../GR32_RangeBars/Classes/TRangeBar/_Body.htm">TRangeBar</a> 
  objects.</p>
<p class="Body">Behavior and appearance of <span class="EmptyRef">TCustomRangeBar</span> 
  is similar to standard <span class="API">TControlScrollBar</span>, defined in 
  Forms.pas, however it does not use the common control library.</p>
<p class="Body">Although range bar may operate as a stand-alone control, most 
  of the time you will use it in conjunction with another control, which has a 
  scrollable region:</p>
<p class="Code"><img src="../../../../../Images/img_014.gif" width="207" height="185" vspace="13"></p>
<p class="Body">Range bars are less limited compared to <span class="API">TControlScrollBar</span>. 
  For example, the size of the range bar can be different from the size of the 
  scrollable control and it may be positioned anywhere in the form. Another difference 
  is that range bars do not hide themselves when scrolling range is less than 
  or equal to the size of the scrollable area, they just become disabled.</p>
<p class="Body">In addition, range bars have nothing to do with scrollable control's 
  client arrea. They neigher shift client origin, nor determine their range automatically.</p>
