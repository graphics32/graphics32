<p class="Body">With the release 1.9.1 SSE2 optimizations have been introduced. 
  The optimizations are entirely based on the MMX optimizations and are meant
  to replace the MMX code for modern systems. The MMX code is only kept for
  backward compatibility.</p>
<p class="Body">The reason to favor SSE2 optimizations over MMX optimizations 
  is mainly due to the dual use of floating point registers. As long as all 
  processing is done solely in fixed point or integer registers, there is no 
  problem, but if floating point needs to be processed an expensive switch 
  between MMX and FPU registers must be performed. This switch is performed 
  within the function EMMS (an intrinsic to the assembler mnemonic with the 
  same name).</p>
<p class="Body">Hence the fact that a call to EMMS uses only a handfull of 
  cycles, frequent calls can slow down simple processing like blending a lot.
  So typically processing of small bitmaps or small areas in bitmaps will 
  benefit mostly from optimizations in which a call to EMMS costs less or is
  even entirely omitted.</p> 
<p class="Body">Unfortunately for sake of backward compatibility it was not 
  possible to switch entirely to SSE2, as there are still many old machines 
  without SSE2, that still benefit from the MMX optimizations. Thus, the 
  existing infrastructure was used, but the EMMS call replaced by a stub, in 
  case SSE2 is available. This stub is only a simple call and return, which has
  the least possible impact.</p> 
<p class="Body">With this stub however - doing nothing - it is not possible to 
  mix SSE2 optimizations with MMX optimizations (while vice versa is possible).
  This means that all optimizations (especially for 3rd party products using 
  GR32 code) must be available in both MMX and SSE2 flavour. Since both 
  technologies are very similar an update should be fairly possible.</p> 
<p class="Body">To get rid of unused MMX optimizations entirely the symbol 
  OMIT_MMX needs to be defined. With this define the EMMS procedure is still 
  present, but due to its inline definition it does not have the slightest 
  impact on performance.</p> 
<p class="Body">NOTE: As all x86 64-bit systems feature SSE2, OMIT_MMX is 
  defined by default here. This does not only result in a better performance,
  but also in smaller executables</p> 
<p class="Body">NOTE: Due to issues with the disassembler in Delphi 7, SSE2 is
  disabled by default. If enabled manually the application should work fine, 
  but debugging the application may result in a crash of the debugger.</p>
