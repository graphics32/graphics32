<p class="Body">Graphics32 defines several functions to support non-uniform lines. 
  This includes gradient lines, dashed lines etc. </p>
<p class="Body">The idea is pretty simple: <a href="../Units/GR32/Classes/TBitmap32/_Body.htm">TBitmap32</a> 
  object holds dynamic array of colors, and a counter, which 'crawls' along the 
  array and reads colors from its position. The line drawing algorithm queries 
  color value from the current counter position at each point, then the counter 
  is automatically incremented to get ready to supply the next value to line rasterisation 
  routine.</p>
<p class="Body">The counter, accessed through <a href="../Units/GR32/Classes/TCustomBitmap32/Properties/StippleCounter.htm">StippleCounter</a> 
  property, wraps itself automatically at the edges of color array. It can move 
  in both directions depending on stipple step, which in turn can be positive 
  or negative. Its malue may even be fractional in this case resulting color is 
  interpolated. The step is accessed with <a href="../Units/GR32/Classes/TCustomBitmap32/Properties/StippleStep.htm">StippleStep</a> 
  property.</p>
<p class="Body"> <a href="../Units/GR32/Classes/TCustomBitmap32/Methods/GetStippleColor.htm">GetStippleColor</a> 
  returns color from the current counter position and automatically increments 
  counter position by the counter step, so that next <a href="../Units/GR32/Classes/TCustomBitmap32/Methods/GetStippleColor.htm">GetStippleColor</a> 
  call will return color value from the next position.</p>
<p class="Body">Drawing functions that support line patterns have 'P' in their 
  postfix (as in LineFSP).</p>
<p class="Body">Warning: the counter is not thread-aware, it is shared by all 
  threads accessing the bitmap. Additional care should be taken when multiple 
  threads draw stippled lines in the same bitmap.</p>
