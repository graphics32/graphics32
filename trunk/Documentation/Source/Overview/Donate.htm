<p class="Body">Graphics32 is free under the terms of the Mozilla Public License. However, if you wish to express your appreciation for the time and energy spend on developing, documenting, supporting and maintaining Graphics32, the team accepts with gratitude any donation made. <br>
			<br>
			Donating should just be thought of as a way of showing appreciation - it will not grant any extra support or focus on specific feature requests. In general the team strives to accommodate and respond as much as possible to user responses and requests.<br>
			<br>
			Two types of donations can be made. Donations for the team in general, which mainly is used to cover general expense related to Graphics32. And donations to individuals involved in the development of Graphics32 (see the list of <a href="Features.htm">features</a>, the list of <a href="../Contributors.htm">contributors</a>, the list of <a href="Changes.htm">changes</a>, source codes or <a href="../Examples.htm">examples</a> to aid your evaluation of the involvement of the individuals). <br>
	If you are <b>unsure what to choose</b>, the developer team donation is recommended.<br>
