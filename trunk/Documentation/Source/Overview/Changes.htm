  <li> fixed access violations in GR32_Transforms</li>
  <li>new sfDraft stretchfilter with MMX and 3Dnow optimization</li>
  <li>new sfCosine stretchfilter</li>

  <li>Performance optimizations (MMX) in blending
        routines and Transforms</li>
  <li>Many other small additions</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="Body">v1.5.1b (5 July 2004)</h2>
<p class="Body">Changed license to MPL. Everything else is identical with v1.5.1.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v1.5.1 (8 June 2003)</h2>
<p class="Body">Fixed resource leaks in TBitmap32.Canvas and TBitmap32.Font.</p>
<p class="Body">A small bug fix in TRubberbandLayer.MouseMove</p>
<p class="Body">Added a new resampling option which is controlled through the 
  FullEdge variable in GR32_Transforms.pas. To see how it affects resampled image, 
  see the new example in the FineResample_Ex directory. The default value of FullEdge 
  is True; change FullEdge back to False to get resampling results as in previous 
  versions.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v1.5 (15 January 2003)</h2>
<p class="Body">Added packages for Delphi 7. The library should also compile with 
  C++ Builder 6.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v1.5 beta 2 (27 July 2002)</h2>
<p class="Body">Completely rewritten bitmap resampling routines: added DstClip 
  parameter to BlockTransfer and StretchTransfer, added new resampling filters. 
  Warning: sfLinear2 filter has been removed - use sfLinear instead. </p>
<p class="Body">Added new TBitamp32 methods: FlipHorz, FlipVert, Rotate90, Rotate180, 
  and Rotate270. Added TBitmap32.Canvas. Some changes in line drawing routines. 
  Faster implementation of TColor &lt;&gt; TColor32 conversion. Other minor bug 
  fixes.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v1.4 (29 March 2002)</h2>
<p class="Body">Fixed a bug in TAffineTransformation. Exposed matrix transformation 
  routines from GR32_Transforms for external use. Fixed handling of very small 
  scales in TImage32. Fixed a bug in non-MMX blending. Fixed BCB packages. Added 
  LoadFromResourceID and LoadFromResourceName wrappers. Some fixes in stippled 
  lines with clipping (still not perfect, but now it should be more consistent). 
  Added TBitmap32.HandleChanged.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v1.3 (12 February 2002)</h2>
<p class="Body">GR32_CPUid.pas is renamed to GR32_System.pas and extended to handle 
  windows xp visual styles. New implementation for range bars and gage bars. Fixed 
  bugs in projective transformations, polygons, and design-time TBitmap32 editor. 
  After a few tweaks the ImgView_Layers_Ex example should work considerable faster. 
  Removed bgMix style from TArrowBar.Bkgnd as well as glyph properties to make 
  range bars and gage bars compatible with visual styles in WindowsXP. Added a 
  new property TPainBox32.Options.</p>
<p class="Body">I established a new Kagi account, so if you would like to support 
  development of Graphics32 and it successor G32, you are very welcome to make 
  your donation <a href="https://order.kagi.com/?GRH" target="_blank">here</a>. 
  Thank you in advance.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v1.2 (15 January 2002)</h2>
<p class="Body">All the units, dfm, etc. files have been renamed from G_*.* to 
  GR_*.*</p>
<p class="Body">Renamed Rect() functions to MakeRect() to provide better BCB compatibility. 
  Renamed TCustomMap.SetSize(Source: TPersistent) to TCustomMap.SetSizeFrom(Source: 
  TPersistent)</p>
<h2 class="Body">v1.01 (30 December 2001)</h2>
<p class="Body">Bug fixes in LineA functions, and scaling 1-pixel size bitmaps. 
  Some steps are taken towards BCB compatibility.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v1.0 (17 September 2001)</h2>
<p class="Body">A small fix in image resampling. Renamed TextOut methods to Textout 
  (I'm not sure, but this might help in BCB compilation).</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.99z (13 August 2001)</h2>
<p class="Body">Included Borland C++ Builder installation packages. Changed references 
  to a new web site. Fixed bugs with polygons and PaintTo method in TImage32.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.99f (3 August 2001)</h2>
<p class="Body">Fixed (I hope) a last small glitch in font resource allocation. 
  A few tune-ups in polygons. Added support for Delphi 6. Design-time and run-time 
  packages have been separated (<b>Note</b>: deinstallation of previous version 
  is required). </p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.99e (31 April 2001)</h2>
<p class="Body">Fixed regarding OnPixelCombine event in TBitmap32. And corresponding 
  code in StretchTransform.</p>
<p class="Body">A couple of new examples added.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.99d (6 February 2001)</h2>
<p class="Body">Changed implementation of FillRect* and FrameRect* functions, 
  now the right/bottom line of pixels is excluded. Inverted rectangles (with negative 
  width or height) are considered empty, they are not drawn any more. This behavior 
  should be more consistent with GDI and with other routines in the library.</p>
<p class="Body">Changed a couple of properties in TCustomRangeBar. Now Range and 
  Increment can be of a floating point type and OnGetWindowSize event is substituted 
  with the Window property.</p>
<p class="Body">Added SizeGrip property to TCustomImgView32, as well as changed 
  the order of the repainting a little bit, now the control scale a bit smoother. 
</p>
<p class="Body">Fixed Win'98 resource leakage in RenderText function.</p>
<p class="Body">Changed UI in the byte maps example.</p>
<p class="Body">Added new example on Graphics32-based custom visual component 
  creation. </p>
<p class="Body">Most likely, this is the final beta release, next one should be 
  v1.0.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.99b</h2>
<p class="Body">Removed OnChanging event from all classes. Fixed a bug in TByteMap.Assign.</p>
<p class="Body">A faster MulDiv implementation.</p>
<p class="Body"></p>
<p class="Body">New mouse events in TCustomImage32 were implemented to simplify 
  mouse interaction with layers. Some internal changes in layer scaling. </p>
<p class="Body">Added the OnDestroy event to layers. Added LOB_NO_UPDATE to layer 
  option bits. Changed TRubberBandLayer to paint itself into the buffer instead 
  of using GDI overlays, removed ResizeOptions and added the OnResizing event. 
</p>
<p class="Body">Added Dst parameter into layer painting functions and events to 
  support layer flattening operation (See TCustomImage32.PaintTo). Added OnInitStages 
  event to TCustomImage32. Also I'm thinking of replacing the GDI overlays with 
  something more useful and less flickering. It is still in the code but their 
  usage is not recommended.</p>
<p class="Body">Implemented a Sutherland-Cohen line clipping algorithm instead 
  of slower Liang-Barsky.</p>
<p class="Body">Added Flush functions to TPaintBox32 for direct copying of the 
  back buffer to the screen.</p>
<p class="Body">Updated some of the examples. </p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.99a (25 September 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">Some speed-ups in resampling functions.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.99 (9 September 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">New documentation is available in HTML Help format. Changed unit 
  names. Changed implementation of TImage32 and layers (see docs). New TPaintBox32 
  does not support layers. TBitmapList32 is renamed to TBitmap32List and a little 
  bit simplified. An couple of bugs fixed in TBitmap32.SetSize. One of them could 
  lead to resource leakage. Also fixed a bug in design-time streaming. TImgView32, 
  a new control introduced in v0.98c is improved and now it is a descendant of 
  TImage32.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.98c (19 July 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">This release is to be considered as beta for v0.99. It contains 
  most of the features planned for v0.99. I release it mostly to check the C++ 
  Builder compatibility, and keep you up-to-date with the current development 
  state. Note, that documentation is not completely updated. DrawLine* functions 
  are changed to Line*. Added an ability to customize bitmap blending equation. 
  Better and faster buffering in TPaintBox32 and its descendants. Perspective 
  transformations are now possible as well. Introduced a new TFixed fixed point 
  data type. A new unit, implementing controls similar to scroll bars is available 
  together with sample control showing how to implement scroll bars with TImage32. 
  Sample control showing how to implement rubber-banding with layers is available 
  as well. New 'X' postfix is introduced to some line drawing routines than operate 
  directly over fixed point arguments.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.98b (3 June 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">Just a few bug fixes.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.98a (22 May 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">A little optimization in TBitmap32.RenderText. A bug in Intensity 
  function fixed. Some fix-ups in PolygonTS.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.98 (17 May 2000) </h2>
<p class="Body">Delphi4 compatibility. New MMX optimization code with automatic 
  MMX detection. A small fix in Bresenham's implementation. DrawLine* functions 
  now have parameter controlling drawing of the last pixel. Added MoveTo*, LineTo* 
  functions. Added text blending/antialiasing. Added polylines and polygons. DrawLineA* 
  functions now support line opacity. Added GR32Bench.xls file with performance 
  test results. Some other small fixes. New examples.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.97a (1 May 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">A bug with FillRectS, FillRectTS fixed. Added a SmartResize property 
  to TPaintBox32, it helps to reduce the amount of back-buffer reallocations when 
  the control resizes.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.97 (29 Apr 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">Complete redesign, no more MMX-specific code since the new integer 
  version works just as fast, no more msimg32.dll dependence. New double buffering 
  scheme, new change notification scheme, completely redesigned overlay layers 
  implementation, new scaling and linear trannsformation implementation. Overall 
  speed improevement.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.95 (5 April 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">Added MMX optimization for pixel blending. It is also used to 
  accelerate bilinear interpolation when performing linear transformations. Well, 
  not a huge increase in performance, but still something. Alternative non-MMX 
  code was rearranged to increase the instruction pairing. It works a bit faster 
  now. A few bugs with color algebra were eliminated. A couple of links regarding 
  low-level optimization is added.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.94 (31 March 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">Added a new unit for byte array mapping. A little reorganization 
  in OnChange event generation. Fixed a bug in DrawLineF/FS functions, when the 
  last point (or part of it) was not always there it was supposed to be.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.93 (23 March 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">Added baTile mode to TImage32.BitmapAlign property. Added linear 
  transformations (See documentation). EndUpdate method of TBitmap32 now does 
  not generate change notification. The Changed method must be called explicitly. 
  New example on linear transformation is available. A few improvements in pixel 
  and line antialiasing.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.92a (17March 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">Win95/NT support bug fixed. This version emulates both bitmap 
  transparency and bitmap alpha blending functions from msimg32.dll, however this 
  emulation is not optimized and will be slower compared to msimg32.dll. Some 
  other small bugs found and destroyed.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.92 (16 March 2000) </h2>
<p class="Body">Sprite scaling is added. Removed Transparent and UseAlpha from 
  TBitmap32 properties. A new property DrawMode is introduced instead. Windows 
  95 and NT compatibility compiler directive is added. TImage32 example is updated 
  and Win95/NT version is posted. See updated documentation for details. </p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.91 (10 March 2000)</h2>
<p class="Body">Some changes in TImage32 component to reduce flicker when DoubleBuffered 
  is turned off. Fixed the multithreading example.</p>
<h2 class="Body">v0.9 (9 March 2000) </h2>
<p class="Body">First public release.</p>
