<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">This rasterizer determines its rasterization path from the intensity difference between samples. It always chooses the path with lowest intensity difference. Due to a higher propability of near execution code and memory loads, this may optimize the CPU cache usage; hence increase in overall performance. To see how this rasterizer works, check the <a href="../../../../Examples.htm#Nested%20Sampling%20Example">nested sampling example</a> and choose this rasterizer.</p>
