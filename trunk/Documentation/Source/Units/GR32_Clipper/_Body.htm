<b>Unit</b> GR32_Clipper

<br>
<p class="Body">The Clipper library primarily performs <b>boolean clipping</b> (intersection, union, difference and xor) on polygons in 2D space. There are no restrictions on either the number nor the type of polygon that can be clipped. They can have holes, be self-intersecting and even have coincident edges. The library also performs <b>polygon offsetting</b>.</p><br>
