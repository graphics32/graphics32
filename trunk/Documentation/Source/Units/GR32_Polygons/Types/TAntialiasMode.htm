<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">Specifies how polygons are antialiased.</p>
<p class="Body">Here is a small illustration that demonstrates the different modes and their output quality:</p>

<p class="Body"><strong>16x</strong> supersampling generally generates the best result, however, it's also the slowest mode.<br>
  <strong>8x</strong> supersampling is a good compromise between speed and quality. <br>
  <strong>4x</strong> supersampling - while being the worst quality-wise next to no antialiasing - is generally the fastest of the three.</p>
<p class="Body">If you need fast but still antialiased polygons (for example in an editor) we recommend using the 4x or 8x
  antialias mode.</p>
