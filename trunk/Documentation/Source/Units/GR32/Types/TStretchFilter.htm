<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">When the bitmap is scaled, these filters control how the colors 
  are interpolated:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sfNearest is the fastest filter, although the quality of the stretched image is fair.</li>
  <li>sfDraft is optimized for fast downsampling. Quality is better than sfNearest. For upsampling sfLinear is used internally.</li>
  <li>sfLinear is several times slower, but it produces more decent results in most cases.</li>
  <li>sfCosine is almost equally fast as sfLinear, but it uses cosine interpolation, which produces a sharper image.</li>
  <li>sfSpline is an approximation of spline interpolation, for some applications its result may be too smooth and blurry,
    but when using with large magnification factors, it usually yields better image compared to sfLinear.</li>
  <li>sfLanczos generally produces the sharpest image (especially when downsampling), however sometimes can produce excessive &quot;ringing&quot; effect
    - this is the slowest filter.</li>
  <li>sfMitchell is often considered as one of the best filters for enlarging images; generally not as sharp as Lanczos.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">In some functions filters above <strong>sfLinear</strong> may 
  not be applicable (for example in Transform), in this case the filter value will be substituted with <b>sfLinear</b>.</p>
