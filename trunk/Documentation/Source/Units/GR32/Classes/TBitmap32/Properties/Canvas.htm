<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">Returns current <i>Canvas instance</i>. You can use that to draw onto the bitmap. However the methods provided
  by <span class="API">TCanvas</span> are mostly slower than using their native Bitmap32 counterparts. So <em>try to avoid the usage of Canvas where possible.</em></p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Special note for CLX users:</strong> Due to the way QT is handling image and bitmap data, please
  try to avoid using only single Canvas operations. Every time you access the Canvas, the internal <span class="API">QImage</span> is unavoidably
  copied to a <span class="API">QPixmap</span> representative and copied back once the Bits property or any other internal method is accessed. So,
  if you access the Bits and Canvas properties in short interval after each other, that poses a heavy performance hit due
  to copying the <span class="API">QImage </span>to<span class="API"> QPixmap</span> back and forth<span class="API">.</span></p>
