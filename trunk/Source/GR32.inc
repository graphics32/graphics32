(* Symbol PUREPASCAL:
   ------------------

      Forces GR32 into pure pascal mode. Should be used only for testing and 
	  debugging purposes.

      (Defined by default for FPC and DARWIN targets in GR32_Compilers.INC.)
	
*)

  {-$DEFINE PUREPASCAL}
  


(* Symbol DEPRECATEDMODE :
   -----------------------

      Defines if GR32 should behave like version 1.7.x and down.

   NOTE: Support for this will be dropped at some time and is only provided
   for transition *)

  {-$DEFINE DEPRECATEDMODE}



(* Symbol CHANGED_IN_PIXELS :
   --------------------------

      Defines if the OnChange / OnAreaChange event should be fired with
      safe pixel setters (PixelS, PixelTS, PixelFS etc.)

   NOTE: While enabling this feature is generally better for the repaint and
   layer optimization, in "lazy code" it is also much slower. *)

  {-$DEFINE CHANGED_IN_PIXELS}



(* Symbol USEINLINING :
   --------------------

      Defines whether to use function inlining.

   NOTE: Enabling this symbol increases executable size but will probably
   result in better performance in most cases. *)

  {$IFDEF INLININGSUPPORTED}
    {$DEFINE USEINLINING}
  {$ENDIF}



(* Symbol USE_GUIDS_IN_MMF :
   -------------------------

    Defines whether to use GUIDs for temporary MMFs filename instead of
    using the GetTempFilename in WinAPI. *)

{-$DEFINE USE_GUIDS_IN_MMF}



(* Symbol USEMOVE :
   ----------------

    Defines whether to use Move instead of MoveLongword. *)

{-$DEFINE USEMOVE}



(* Symbol XPTHEMES :
   -----------------

    Enable support for windows xp themes. Eventually undefine if GR32 should
    be used within a DLL *)

  {$DEFINE XPTHEMES}



(* Symbol USEMULTITHREADING :
   --------------------------

    Use multithreading by default if possible. *)

  {-$DEFINE USEMULTITHREADING}



(* FastCode specific symbols:
    Adding these symbols to your project's define list will force use of the
    particular routine over the standard GR32 routine.

   GR32_FASTCODEMOVE - Uses the patched Move routine rather than MoveLongword.

   For more information on the FastCode project take a look at this URL:
     http://fastcode.sourceforge.net/

   For FastMove make sure to download the CPU id based function, ie. runtime
   RTL patching.

(*
  Symbol OMIT_MMX:
  ----------------

     If defined MMX optimizations are not used (omitted)

   For faster pixel/color processing, MMX can be used which results in a huge
   performance boost over PUREPASCAL code or native assembler code.
   However, there's a penalty (a call to EMMS) when switching between FPU and
   MMX registers. This call is not necessary when SSE2 is available. Though,
   for backward compatibility it is necessary to call EMMS even if SSE2 is used.

   NOTE: On every x64 system SSE2 is available and thus MMX support is not
   necessary. In fact it is problematic in case the Delphi XE2 compiler is used.
