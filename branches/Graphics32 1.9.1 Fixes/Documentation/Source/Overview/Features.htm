<p class="Body">Many features in Graphics32 are similar to those in standard <span class="API">TImage</span>, 
  <span class="API">TBitmap</span> and <span class="API">TCanvas</span> classes, 
  however they were rewritten to accelerate and optimize drawing on 32-bit device-independent 
  bitmaps (DIBs). It also includes a few new options.</p>
<p class="Body">Some of its features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fast per-pixel access up to 100 times faster compared to standard <span class="API">TCanvas</span>/<span class="API">TBitmap</span>;</li>
  <li>High-performance Bitmap alpha blending (including per-pixel alpha blending);</li>
  <li>Pixel, line and polygon antialiasing with sub-pixel accuracy (combined with 
    alpha blending);</li>
  <li>Arbitrary polygon transformations and custom fillings;</li>
  <li>Bitmap resampling with high quality reconstruction filters (e.g. Lanczos, 
    Cubic, Mitchell);</li>
  <li>A unique state-of-the-art <a href="../Additional Topics/Sampling and Rasterization.htm">rasterization 
    system</a>;</li>
  <li>Affine transformations of bitmaps: rotations, scaling, etc with sub-pixel 
    accuracy;</li>
  <li>Arbitrary projective transformations of bitmaps;</li>
  <li>Arbitrary remapping transformations of bitmaps (e.g. for Warping, Morphing);</li>
  <li>Flexible supersampling implementation for maximum sampling quality;</li>
  <li>Flicker-free image displaying components with optimized double buffering 
    via advanced <a href="../Additional Topics/Repaint Optimization.htm">MicroTiles 
    based repaint optimizer</a>;</li>
  <li>Multiple customizible easy-to-use overlay layers;</li>
  <li>Locking of bitmaps for safe multithreading;</li>
  <li>Platform independent code;</li>
  <li>Switchable surface-managing back-ends;</li>
  <li>A property editor for RGB and alpha channel loading;</li>
  <li>Design-time loading of image formats supported by standard <span class="API">TPicture</span>;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">Except for extended features, Graphics32 has some important differences 
  from the standard components. It does not heavily rely on Windows GDI, most of the 
  functions are reimplemented and optimized specifically for 32-bit pixel format.</p>
