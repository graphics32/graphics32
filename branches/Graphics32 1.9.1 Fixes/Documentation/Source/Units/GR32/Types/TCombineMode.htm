<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">TCombineMode</span> defines how <em>drawing operations</em> combine the foreground color with
  the background.<br>
  It also determines how a bitmap is combined with the background when <a href="../Classes/TCustomBitmap32/Properties/DrawMode.htm">DrawMode</a> is
  set to dmBlend. </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>cmBlend</strong> - Fast blending of foreground color with the background color using the supplied alpha. This method is
    not suited for working and preserving alpha-channels. Use this more if you want to blend directly to the display buffer.</li>
  <li><strong>cmMerge</strong> - 
Uses a completely different formula that also merges the alpha-channels. This mode is slower than blending but
is suited for working with alpha-channels (eg. when composing in temporary buffers).</li>
</ul>
