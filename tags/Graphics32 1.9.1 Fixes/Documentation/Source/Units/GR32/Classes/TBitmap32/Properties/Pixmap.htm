<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">Returns a pointer to the current Pixmap instance. You can use that if you're working directly with QT related
  methods.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>Important Note: </strong>Due to the nature of QT handling images and bitmap information, there is
  a need to notify TBitmap32 about changes you made to the QPixmap. You can use the PixmapChanged property to
  do so.<br>
  This will copy the Pixmap content as
  soon as the Bits property is accessed or some internal function is accessing the image data directly. This will make sure
  that the content is copied from the QPixmap to the internal QImage in TBitmap32.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="Comment">This property is only available in the CLX version. For VCL use the property <a href="BitmapHandle.htm">BitmapHandle</a> instead.</p>
