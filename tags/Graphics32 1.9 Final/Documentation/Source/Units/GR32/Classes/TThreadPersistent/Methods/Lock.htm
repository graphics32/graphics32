<p class="Decl"><b>procedure</b> Lock; </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">Blocks other execution threads from locking the object until the 
  <a href="Unlock.htm">Unlock</a> method is called. If another thread tryes to 
  call the <span class="EmptyRef">Lock</span> method of an object which is already 
  locked, its execution will be stalled until the lock is released with <a href="Unlock.htm">Unlock</a> 
  method.</p>
<p class="Body">Once a thread has locked the object, it can make additional calls 
  to <span class="EmptyRef">Lock</span> method without blocking its own execution. 
  This prevents the thread from deadlocking itself while waiting for releasing 
  of a lock that it already owns. <a href="../Properties/LockCount.htm">LockCount</a> 
  is increased each time <span class="EmptyRef">Lock</span> is called.</p>
