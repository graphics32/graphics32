<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body">Specifies how polygons are antialiased.</p>
<p class="Body">Here is a small illustration that demonstrates the different modes and their output quality:</p>

<p class="Body"><strong>32x</strong> supersampling generally generates the best result. However, it is also the slowest mode.<br>
  <strong>16x</strong> supersampling  generates a very smooth result. Generally, there is no noticeable difference in quality between this and the 32x mode.<br>
  <strong>8x</strong> supersampling is a good compromise between speed and quality. <br>
<strong>4x</strong> supersampling  offers an acceptable tradeoff between speed and quality. <br>
<strong>2x </strong>supersampling 
offers the worst quality, but still has a higher precision than rendering without any antialiasing.</p>
<p class="Body">If you need fast but still antialiased polygons (for example in an editor) we recommend using the 4x or 8x
  antialias mode.</p>
