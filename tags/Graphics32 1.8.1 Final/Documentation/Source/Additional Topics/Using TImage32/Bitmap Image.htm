<p class="Body">A bitmap image is represented with a <a href="../../Units/GR32/Classes/TBitmap32/_Body.htm">TBitmap32</a> 
  object and is stored in the <a href="../../Units/GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Properties/Bitmap.htm">Bitmap</a> 
  property. Its scale and location within the control is determined by the following 
  properties:</p>
<p class="Body"><a href="../../Units/GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Properties/BitmapAlign.htm">BitmapAlign</a> 
  &#151; specifies if the bitmap image is positioned at the top-left corner of 
  the control (baTopLeft), centered (baCenter), tiled (baTile) or it its exact 
  location is determined by <a href="../../Units/GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Properties/OffsetHorz.htm">OffsetHorz</a> 
  and <a href="../../Units/GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Properties/OffsetVert.htm">OffsetVert</a> 
  properties;</p>
<p class="Body"><a href="../../Units/GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Properties/ScaleMode.htm">ScaleMode</a> 
  &#151; indicates if the bitmap image is displayed with its original size (smNormal), 
  stretched to fit the control's boundaries (smStretch), proportionally resized 
  to fit the control's boundaries(smResize) or proportionally scaled using its 
  <a href="../../Units/GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Properties/Scale.htm">Scale</a> 
  property (smScale).</p>
<p class="Code"><img src="../../../Images/img_015.gif" width="397" height="301" vspace="8"></p>
<p class="Body">The bitmap image is combined with the back-buffer according to 
  its <a href="../../Units/GR32/Classes/TBitmap32/Properties/DrawMode.htm">DrawMode</a> 
  property. And the quality of its resampling is determined by the <a href="../../Units/GR32/Classes/TBitmap32/Properties/StretchFilter.htm">StretchFilter</a> 
  property. If its <a href="../../Units/GR32/Classes/TBitmap32/Properties/DrawMode.htm">DrawMode</a> 
  is dmCustom, the bitmap will fire a series of <a href="../../Units/GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/Events/OnPixelCombine.htm">OnPixelCombine</a> 
  events.</p>
