<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">TCustomPaintBox32</span> is a common ancestor 
  for <a href="../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TPaintBox32/_Body.htm">TPaintBox32</a> and <a href="../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TCustomImage32/_Body.htm">TCustomImage32</a> 
  objects.</p>
<p class="Body">In addition to properties, inherited from <span class="API">TCustomControl</span>, 
  it provides optimized double buffering. The back buffer is a <a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TBitmap32/_Body.htm">TBitmap32</a> 
  object, which stores an image data before flushing it to the screen.</p>
<p class="Body">Since <span class="EmptyRef">TCustomPaintBox32</span> is double 
  buffered, there is no need to redraw its contents every time the control receives 
  WM_PAINT message, as with standard <span class="API">TPaintBox</span>. The repainting 
  is still required when the control is resized.</p>
