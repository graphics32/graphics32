<h2>Description</h2>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">TBitmap32</span> is the central class in 
  the Graphics32 library. It manages a single 32-bit device-independent bitmap 
  (DIB) and provides methods for drawing on it and combining it with other DIBs 
  or other objects with device context (DC).</p>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">TBitmap32</span> overrides <span class="API">Assign</span> 
  and <span class="API">AssignTo</span> methods (inherited from <span class="API">TPersistent</span>) 
  to provide compatibility with standard objects: <span class="API">TBitmap</span>, 
  <span class="API">TPicture</span> and <span class="API">TClipboard</span> in 
  both directions. The design-time streaming to and from *.dfm files, inherited 
  from <span class="API">TPersistent</span>, is supported, but its realization 
  is different from streaming with other stream types (See the source code for 
  details). </p>
<p class="Body"><span class="EmptyRef">TBitmap32</span> does not implement its 
  own low-level streaming or low-level file loading/saving. Instead, it uses streaming 
  methods of temporal <span class="API">TBitmap</span> or <span class="API">TPicture</span> 
  objects. This is an obvious performance penalty, however such approach allows 
  using third-party libraries, which extend <span class="API">TGraphic</span> 
  class for various image formats support (JPEG, TGA, TIFF, GIF, PNG, etc.). When 
  you install them, <span class="EmptyRef">TBitmap32</span> will automatically 
  obtain support for new image file formats in design time and in run time. </p>
<p class="Body">Since <span class="EmptyRef">TBitmap32</span> is a descendant 
  of <a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TThreadPersistent/_Body.htm">TThreadPersistent</a>, it inherits 
  its locking mechanism and it may be used in multi-threaded applications.</p>
<h2>Change Notification</h2>
<p class="Body">Change notification events (<a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TThreadPersistent/Events/OnChange.htm">OnCange</a>, 
  <a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TCustomMap/Events/OnResize.htm">OnResize</a>), inherited from <a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TThreadPersistent/_Body.htm">TThreadPersistent</a> 
  and <a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TCustomMap/_Body.htm">TCustomMap</a> are generated by most drawing/resizing 
  etc. functions with a few exceptions. Due to performance considerations the 
  following functions are not accompanied with event generation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pixel-based operations (SetPixelT, SetPixelF...); </li>
  <li>HorzLine* and VertLine* functions;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">If necessary, the <a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TThreadPersistent/Events/OnChange.htm">OnCange</a> 
  event may be generated explicitly by calling the <a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TThreadPersistent/Methods/Changed.htm">Changed</a> 
  methods.</p>
<p class="Body">Normally, if the bitmap is a part of some container (<a href="../../../GR32_Image/Classes/TImage32/_Body.htm">TImage32</a>, 
  <a href="../../../GR32_Layers/Classes/TBitmapLayer/_Body.htm">TBitmapLayer</a>, 
  etc.), its change notification events are linked to the container, causing repaint 
  operations. When making several simultaneous changes, it may be beneficial to 
  enclose them in <a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TThreadPersistent/Methods/BeginUpdate.htm">BeginUpdate</a>…<a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TThreadPersistent/Methods/EndUpdate.htm">EndUpdate</a> 
  block followed by the <a href="../../../GR32/Classes/TThreadPersistent/Methods/Changed.htm">Changed</a> 
  call to reduce the amount of repaintings of the container.</p>
