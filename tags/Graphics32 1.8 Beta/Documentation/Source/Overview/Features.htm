<p class="Body">Many features in Graphics32 are similar to those in standard <span class="API">TImage</span>, 
  <span class="API">TBitmap</span> and <span class="API">TCanvas</span> classes, 
  however they were rewritten to accelerate and optimize drawing on 32-bit device-independent 
  bitmaps (DIBs). It also includes a few new options.</p>
<p class="Body">Some of its features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fast per-pixel access up to 100 times faster compared to standard <span class="API">TCanvas</span>/<span class="API">TBitmap</span>;</li>
  <li>Bitmap alpha blending (including per-pixel alpha blending);</li>
  <li>Pixel, line and polygon antialiasing (combined with alpha blending);</li>
  <li>polygon transformations and custom fillings;</li>
  <li>Locking the bitmap for safe multithreading;</li>
  <li>Enhanced scaling of bitmaps;</li>
  <li>Affine transformations of bitmaps: rotations, scaling, etc with sub-pixel 
    accuracy;</li>
  <li>Arbitrary projective transformations of bitmaps;</li>
  <li>Flicker-free image displaying components with optimized double buffering; 
  </li>
  <li>Multiple customizible easy-to-use overlay layers;</li>
  <li>A property editor for RGB and alpha channel loading;</li>
  <li>Design-time loading of image formats supported by standard <span class="API">TPicture</span>;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">Except for extended features, Graphics32 has some important differences 
  from standard components. It does not heavily rely on Windows GDI, most of the 
  functions are reimplemented and optimized specifically for 32-bit pixel format.</p>
